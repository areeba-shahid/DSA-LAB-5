Lab 5: LeetCode Problem and Vectors
Objective
In this lab, we are working on a LeetCode problem involving vectors, where we will implement a solution using C++ (or your preferred language). The goal is to practice using vectors for efficient data manipulation and solving algorithmic problems.

Problem Statement
Provide the description of the LeetCode problem you're working on. For example:

Problem: LeetCode Problem #XXX: Problem Name

You can provide a brief description of the problem here.
Example Problem:

Problem: Given an array of integers, find the maximum product of two integers in the array. Return the product of the two integers that give the highest product.
Input:
A vector of integers (e.g., nums = [2, 3, -2, 4]).
Output:
An integer representing the maximum product of two integers.
Approach
Step 1: Analyze the Problem
Begin by understanding the problem statement and identifying any edge cases (e.g., empty vectors, one element, etc.).
Step 2: Define the Solution
Using vectors in C++ (or your preferred language), we will iterate over the input array and use a specific algorithm to find the solution.
In this case, you might want to use a brute-force solution or an optimized approach (e.g., sorting, dynamic programming, etc.).
